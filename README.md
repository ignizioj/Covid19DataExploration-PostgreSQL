# Covid-19 Dataset Cleaned and Explored in PostgreSQL, Dashboard in Tableau using Custom Queries
#### This project was built from exploratory questions about how many individuals have died from Covid-19 as defined, to determine the total death count by continent, to determine the current death percentage and how it has adjusted with vaccinations, and finally to look at percent of population infected by country.  For simplicity, I have selected only a few countries to examine including Canada, China, France, India, Italy, Mexico, Spain, UK, and the United States.  

##### In the dataset were roughly 200,000 rows of information on Covid-19 and included everything from vaccination rates to ages and health problems.  I reformatted one field.  The dataset was one large Excel file of which I broke up into two different tables.  The first was CovidDeaths and the second CovidVaccinations. I also checked for and removed any duplicates in the tables.  I have included both tables in the repo as well as my SQL queries.  


##### Below are screenshots of the exploratory SQL queries.

##### Below is a screenshot of the custom SQL queries used in Tableau as well as the dashboard built with this data. Please explore!  I have also included a link to the interactive dashboard hosted by Tableau Public. View here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/joel.ignizio/viz/CovidDashboard2022_16579249127750/Dashboard1
